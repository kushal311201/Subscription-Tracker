Subscription Manager App Icons

For the app to work properly as a Progressive Web App (PWA), you need to create two icon images:

1. icon-192.png (192x192 pixels)
2. icon-512.png (512x512 pixels)

These icons should be placed in this directory (images folder).

You can create these icons using any image editing software like Photoshop, GIMP, or even online tools like:
- Canva (https://www.canva.com)
- PWA Builder Image Generator (https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator)

Icon Design Tips:
- Use a simple, recognizable design that looks good at small sizes
- Include some padding around the main logo/icon (about 10-15% on each side)
- Use a solid background color rather than transparency for best results on mobile
- Make sure the icon represents what your app does (e.g., a calendar or money symbol for a subscription tracker)

Placeholder Icons:
Currently, the app is set up with basic placeholder icons. For best results, replace these with your own custom-designed icons.

Testing Your Icons:
After adding your icons, refresh the app in your browser. If you've installed it as a PWA, you may need to uninstall and reinstall it to see the new icons take effect.

Maskable Icons:
For the best experience on Android, consider creating "maskable" icons that fill the entire icon area. Learn more here:
